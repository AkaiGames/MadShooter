###### Brief introduction:

This is a promissing and innovative cross platform game where you may enter the battle yourself or build your own bots to join the siege in your behalf! The AI of bots will be programmed in Lua. This project is inspired by [Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net).
Further details will be added in a couple of days.
Check the repo later for updates or join the team.
